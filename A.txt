Binary search tree property
Binary trie
A binary tree whose structure is that of a trie. Generally this is an implementation for a search tree. This means that the search key values are thought of a binary digits, with the digit in the position corresponding to this a node’s level in the tree indicating a left branch if it is “0”, or a right branch if it is “1”. Examples include the Huffman coding tree and the Bintree.

Binning
In hashing, binning is a type of hash function. Say we are given keys in the range 0 to 999, and have a hash table of size 10. In this case, a possible hash function might simply divide the key value by 100. Thus, all keys in the range 0 to 99 would hash to slot 0, keys 100 to 199 would hash to slot 1, and so on. In other words, this hash function “bins” the first 100 keys to the first slot, the next 100 keys to the second slot, and so on. 
Binsort
Bintree

Binsort
A sort that works by taking each record and placing it into a bin based on its value. The bins are then gathered up in order to sort the list. It is generally not practical in this form, but it is the conceptual underpinning of the radix sort.

Bounding box
A box (usually aligned to the coordinate axes of the reference system) that contains a (potentially complex) object. In graphics and computational geometry, complex objects might be associated with a bounding box for use by algorithms that search for objects in a particular location. The idea is that if the bounding box is not within the area of interest, then neither is the object. Checking the bounding box is cheaper than checking the object, but it does require some time.

Buffer pool
A collection of one or more buffers. The buffer pool is an example of a cache. It is stored in primary storage, and holds data that is expected to be used in the near future. When a data value is requested, the buffer pool is searched first. If the value is found in the buffer pool, then secondary storage need not be accessed. If the value is not found in the buffer pool, then it must be fetched from secondary storage. A number of traditional heuristics have been developed for deciding which data to flush from the buffer pool when new data must be stored, such as least recently used.
Buffer
Buffering
Buffer passing
Buffering
A synonym for caching. More specifically, it refers to an arrangement where all accesses to data (such as on a peripheral storage device) must be done in multiples of some minimum unit of storage. On a disk drive, this basic or smallest unit of I/O is a sector. It is called “buffering” because the block of data returned by such an access is stored in a buffer.

Cluster
In file processing, a collection of physically adjacent sectors that define the smallest allowed allocation unit of space to a disk file. The idea of requiring space to be allocated in multiples of sectors is that this will reduce the number of extents required to store the file, which reduces the expected number of seek operations reuquired to process a series of disk accesses to the file. The disadvantage of large cluster size is that it increases internal fragmentation since any space not actually used by the file in the last cluster is wasted.

Comparable
The concept that two objects can be compared to determine if they are equal or not, or to determine which one is greater than the other. In set notation, elements x and y of a set are comparable under a given relation R if either xRy or yRx. To be reliably compared for a greater/lesser relationship, the values being compared must belong to a total order. In programming, the property of a data type such that two elements of the type can be compared to determine if they the same (a weaker version), or which of the two is larger (a stronger version). Comparable is also the name of an interface in Java that asserts a comparable relationship between objects with a class, and .compareTo() is the Comparable interface method that implements the actual comparison between two objects of the class.
-
-
-
Comparator
A function given as a parameter to a method of a library (or alternatively, a parameter for a C++ template or a Java generic). The comparator function concept provides a generic way encapulates the process of performing a comparison between two objects of a specific type. For example, if we want to write a generic sorting routine, that can handle any record type, we can require that the user of the sorting routine pass in a comparator function to define how records in the collection are to be compared.
-
-
-
Comparison
The act of comparing two keys or records. For many data types, a comparison has constant time cost. The number of comparisons required is often used as a measure of cost for sorting and searching algorithms.

Compiler
A computer program that reads computer programs and converts them into a form that can be directly excecuted by some form of computer. The major phases in a compiler include lexical analysis, syntax analysis, intermediate code generation, code optimization, and code generation. More broadly, a compiler can be viewed as parsing the program to verify that it is syntactically correct, and then doing code generation to convert the hig-level program into something that the computer can execute.

Complete binary tree
A binary tree where the nodes are filled in row by row, with the bottom row filled in left to right. Due to this requirement, there is only one tree of n nodes for any value of n. Since storing the records in an array in row order leads to a simple mapping from a node’s position in the array to its parent, siblings, and children, the array representation is most commonly used to implement the complete binary tree. The heap data structure is a complete binary tree with partial ordering constraints on the node values.

Composite design pattern
Given a class hierarchy representing a set of objects, and a container for a collection of objects, the composite design pattern addresses the relationship between the object hierarchy and a bunch of behaviors on the objects. In the composite design, each object is required to implement the collection of behaviors. This is in contrast to the procedural approach where a behavior (such as a tree traversal) is implemented as a method on the object collection (such as a tree). Procedural tree traversal requires that the tree have a method that understands what to do when it encounters any of the object types (internal or leaf nodes) that the tree might contain. The composite approach would have the tree call the “traversal” method on its root node, which then knows how to perform the “traversal” behavior. This might in turn require invoking the traversal method of other objects (in this case, the children of the root).

A process for finding the closed form for a recurrence relation, that involves substituting in a guess for the closed form to replace the recursive part(s) of the recurrence. Depending on the goal (typically either to show that the hypothesized growth rate is right, or to find the precise constants), one then manipulates the resulting non-recursive equation.

Cylinder
A disk drive normally consists of a stack of platters. While this might not be so true today, traditionally all of the I/O heads moved together during a seek operation. Thus, when a given I/O head is positioned over a particular track on a platter, the other I/O heads are also positioned over the corresponding track on their platters. That collection of tracks is called a cylinder. A given cylinder represents all of the data that can be read from all of the platters without doing another seek operation.

Heap
This term has two different meanings. Uncommonly, it is a synonym for free store. Most often it is used to refer to a particular data structure. This data structure is a complete binary tree with the requirement that every node has a value greater than its children (called a max heap), or else the requirement that every node has a value less than its children (called a min heap). Since it is a complete binary tree, a heap is nearly always implemented using an array rather than an explicit tree structure. To add a new value to a heap, or to remove the extreme value (the max value in a max-heap or min value in a min-heap) and update the heap, takes Θ(logn) time in the worst case. However, if given all of the values in an unordered array, the values can be re-arranged to form a heap in only Θ(n) time. Due to its space and time efficiency, the heap is a popular choice for implementing a priority queue.
-
-
-
Heapsort
A sorting algorithm that costs Θ(nlogn) time in the best, average, and worst cases. It tends to be slower than Mergesort and Quicksort. It works by building a max heap, and then repeatedly removing the item with maximum key value (moving it to the end of the heap) until all elements have been removed (and replaced at their proper location in the array).

A design pattern that is meant to solve the following problem: You have an application with many objects. Some of these objects are identical in the information that they contain, and the role that they play. But they must be reached from various places, and conceptually they really are distinct objects. Because there is so much duplication of the same information, we want to reduce memory cost by sharing that space.

Handle
When using a memory manager to store data, the client will pass data to be stored (the message) to the memory manager, and the memory manager will return to the client a handle. The handle encodes the necessary information that the memory manager can later use to recover and return the message to the client. This is typically the location and length of the message within the memory pool.

-
-
-
Jump search
An algorithm for searching a sorted list, that falls between sequential search and binary search in both computational cost and conceptual complexity. The idea is to keep jumping by some fixed number of positions until a value is found that is bigger than search key K, then do a sequential search over the subarray that is now known to contain the search key. The optimal number of steps to jump will be n−−√ for an array of size n, and the worst case cost will be Θ(n−−√).

Kd tree
A spatial data structure that uses a binary tree to store a collection of data records based on their (point) location in space. It uses the concept of a discriminator at each level to decide which single component of the multi-dimensional search key to branch on at that level. It uses a key-space decomposition, meaning that all data records in the left subtree of a node have a value on the corresponding discriminator that is less than that of the node, while all data records in the right subtree have a greater value. The bintree is the image-space decomposition analog of the kd tree.

Key sort
Any sorting operation applied to a collection of key-value pairs where the value in this case is a reference to a complete record (that is, a pointer to the record in memory or a position for a record on disk). This is in contrast to a sorting operation that works directly on a collection of records. The intention is that the collection of key-value pairs is far smaller than the collection of records themselves. As such, this might allow for an internal sort when sorting the records directly would require an external sort. The collection of key-value pairs can also act as an index.

Least frequently used
Abbreviated LFU, it is a heuristic that can be used to decide which buffer in a buffer pool to flush when data in the buffer pool must be replaced by new data being read into a cache. However, least recently used is more popular than LFU. Analogous to the frequency count heuristic for maintaining a self-organizing list.

Non-deterministic
In a finite automata, at least one state has multiple transitions on at least one symbol. This means that it is not deterministic about what transition to take in that situation. A non-deterministic machine is said to accept a string if it completes execution on the string in an accepting state under at least one choice of non-deterministic transitions. Generally, non-determinism can be simulated with a deterministic machine by alternating between the execution that would take place under each of the branching choices.

Non-deterministic choice
An operation that captures the concept of nondeterminism. A nondeterministic choice can be viewed as either “correctly guessing” between a set of choices, or implementing each of the choices in parallel. In the parallel view, the nondeterminism was successful if at least one of the choices leads to a correct answer.

radix sort
A sorting algorithm that works by processing records with k digit keys in k passes, where each pass sorts the records according to the current digit. At the end of the process, the records will be sorted. This can be efficient if the number of digits is small compared to the number of records. However, if the n records all have unique key values, than at least Ω(logn) digits are required, leading to an Ω(nlogn) sorting algorithm that tends to be much slower than other sorting algorithms like Quicksort or mergesort.

random access memory
Abbreviated RAM, this is the principle example of primary storage in a modern computer. Data access times are typically measured in billionths of a second (microseconds), which is roughly a million times faster than data access from a disk drive. RAM is where data are held for immediate processing, since access times are so much faster than for secondary storage. RAM is a typical part of a computer’s memory hierarchy.

In hashing, a tombstone is used to mark a slot in the hash table where a record has been deleted. Its purpose is to allow the collision resolution process to probe through that slot (so that records further down the probe sequence are not unreachable after deleting the record), while also allowing the slot to be reused by a future insert operation.

topological sort
The process of laying out the vertices of a DAG in a linear order such that no vertex A in the order is preceded by a vertex that can be reached by a (directed) path from A. Usually the (directed) edges in the graph define a prerequisite system, and the goal of the topological sort is to list the vertices in an order such that no prerequisites are violated.

trie
A form of search tree where an internal node represents a split in the key space at a predetermined location, rather than split based on the actual key values seen. For example, a simple binary search trie for key values in the range 0 to 1023 would store all records with key values less than 512 on the left side of the tree, and all records with key values equal to or greater than 512 on the right side of the tree. A trie is always a full tree. Folklore has it that the term comes from “retrieval”, and should be pronounced as “try” (in contrast to “tree”, to distinguish the differences in the space decomposition method of a search tree versus a search trie). The term “trie” is also sometimes used as a synonym for the alphabet trie.

underflow
The condition where the amount of data stored in an entity has dropped below some minimum threshold. For example, a node in a B-tree is required to be at least half full. If a record deletion causes the node to be less than half full, then it is in a condition of underflow, and something has to be done to correct this.

virtual memory
A memory management technique for making relatively fast but small memory appear larger to the program. The large “virtual” data space is actually stored on a relatively slow but large backing storage device, and portions of the data are copied into the smaller, faster memory as needed by use of a buffer pool. A common example is to use RAM to manage access to a large virtual space that is actually stored on a disk drive. The programmer can implement a program as though the entire data content were stored in RAM, even if that is larger than the physical RAM available making it easier to implement.

visitor
A design pattern where a traversal process is given a function (known as the visitor) that is applied to every object in the collection being traversed. For example, a generic tree or graph traversal might be designed such that it takes a function parameter, where that function is applied to each node.

worst case
In algorithm analysis, the problem instance from among all problem instances for a given input size n that has the greatest cost. Note that the worst case is not when n is big, since we are referring to the wrost from a class of inputs (i.e, we want the worst of those inputs of size n).

Zipf distribution
A data distribution that follows Zipf’s law, an emprical observation that many types of data studied in the physical and social sciences follow a power law probability distribution. That is, the frequency of any record in the data collection is inversely proportional to its rank when the collection is sorted by frequency. Thus, the most frequently appearing record has a frequency much higher than the next most frequently appearing record, which in turn has a frequency much higher than the third (but with ratio slightly lower than that for the first two records) and so on. The 80/20 rule is a casual characterization of a Zipf distribution. Adherence to a Zipf distribution is important to the successful operation of a cache or self-organizing list.

zone
In memory management, the concept that different parts of the memory pool are handled in different ways. For example, some of the memory might be handled by a simple freelist, while other portions of the memory pool might be handled by a sequential fit memory manager. On a disk drive the concept of a zone relates to the fact that there are limits to the maximum data density, combined with the fact that the need for the same angular distance to be used for a sector in each track means that tracks further from the center of the disk will become progressively less dense. A zone in this case is a series of adjacent tracks whose data density is set by the maximum density of the innermost track of that zone
