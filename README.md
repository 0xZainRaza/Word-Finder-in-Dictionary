# Word Finder for Dictionary

This project demonstrates the usage of a Dictionary application implemented in C++. The application manages words and their corresponding meanings, using a .txt file as the database tool. The primary objective is to provide a more efficient way of searching for word meanings compared to traditional dictionary methods.

Our application streamlines the process of searching for word meanings by efficiently retrieving the entered word and presenting its corresponding meaning. Additionally, the system suggests related words, enhancing the user experience and expanding their vocabulary.


## Project Description
A Dictionary is a crucial data structure used to store information in a key-value format, typically listing words alphabetically with their meanings. This project aims to enhance the traditional dictionary by utilizing a .txt file as a database and employing C++ as the front-end tool. The system is designed to reduce time complexity in word searches through the implementation of hash tables and trie data structures.

### Functionality
The project offers the following functionalities:

1. **Data Insertion:**
   - Insert new words into the dictionary for continual updates.

2. **Data Deletion:**
   - Remove unnecessary words or correct data inaccuracies.

3. **Data Searching:**
   - Search for the meanings of specific words efficiently.

4. **Suggestions:**
   - Provide additional suggested words during word searches.
