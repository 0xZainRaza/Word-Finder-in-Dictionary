# Word Finder for Dictionary

This project demonstrates the usage of a Dictionary application implemented in C++. The application manages words and their corresponding meanings, using a .txt file as the database tool. The primary objective is to provide a more efficient way of searching for word meanings compared to traditional dictionary methods.

## Project Description
A Dictionary is a crucial data structure used to store information in a key-value format, typically listing words alphabetically with their meanings. This project aims to enhance the traditional dictionary by utilizing a .txt file as a database and employing C++ as the front-end tool. The system is designed to reduce time complexity in word searches through the implementation of hash tables and trie data structures.

### Functionality
The project offers the following functionalities:

1. **Data Insertion:**
   - Insert new words into the dictionary for continual updates.

2. **Data Deletion:**
   - Remove unnecessary words or correct data inaccuracies.

3. **Data Searching:**
   - Search for the meanings of specific words efficiently.

4. **Suggestions:**
   - Provide additional suggested words during word searches.
