# Word Finder for Dictionary

This project demonstrates the usage of a Dictionary application implemented in C++. The application manages words and their corresponding meanings, using a .txt file as the database tool. The primary objective is to provide a more efficient way of searching for word meanings compared to traditional dictionary methods.

Our application streamlines the process of searching for word meanings by efficiently retrieving the entered word and presenting its corresponding meaning. Additionally, the system suggests related words, enhancing the user experience and expanding their vocabulary.

## Project Description
A Dictionary is a crucial data structure used to store information in a key-value format, typically listing words alphabetically with their meanings. This project aims to enhance the traditional dictionary by utilizing a .txt file as a database and employing C++ as the front-end tool. The system is designed to reduce time complexity in word searches through the implementation of hash tables and trie data structures.

### Functionality
The project offers the following functionalities:

1. **Data Insertion:**
   - Words can be added to the dictionary by manually writing them in a text file. This enables continual updates to the dictionary.

2. **Search Meaning:**
   - Searches for the meanings of specific words efficiently.
   - Looks for the entered word in suggested words, providing a comprehensive understanding.

3. **Word Count:**
   - Displays the total count of words available in the dictionary.

4. **Word of the Day:**
   - Suggests a random word from the dictionary, enhancing vocabulary exploration.

5. **Display Dictionary:**
   - Displays all available words in the dictionary, providing a comprehensive view.
